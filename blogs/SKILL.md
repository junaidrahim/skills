# Technical Blog

Junaid's technical blog at https://junaid.foo

## Philosophy: Binge Bank

From `Notes/Binge Banks and Content Catalogs.md`:

- Build a **bingeable catalog** that shows who you are
- Timeless content > viral chasing
- When someone comes looking, give them depth to explore
- More iterations >>> — keep producing, something will hit
- Don't rewire your reward pathway from expression to metrics

**Goal:** Create a track record that reflects the work and establishes credibility.

## Focus Areas

Technical content around:
- Data engineering
- System architecture
- Developer experience
- Database internals
- Distributed systems
- Lessons from real work (abstracted appropriately)

## Friday Writing Session

**When:** Every Friday
**Time:** 2-3 hours blocked
**Tasks:**
- Groom existing drafts
- Outline new ideas
- Push at least one draft forward
- Aim for one publishable post

Add to daily note on Fridays:
```
- [ ] Technical writing session (2-3h)
```

## Heartbeat Integration

On Fridays, nudge:
- "It's Friday — time for your technical writing session. What draft are you working on?"
- Surface any blog ideas captured during the week

## Workflow

1. **Capture ideas** — daily notes, `Notes/Blog Ideas/`
2. **Draft in Obsidian** — `Notes/Blogs/Drafts/`
3. **Friday sessions** — groom, write, refine
4. **Publish** — when ready, move to junaid.foo

## When Helping

- Help structure technical explanations
- Suggest angles that show depth without leaking proprietary details
- Push for clarity — technical but accessible
- Remind: this is about building a catalog, not chasing virality
