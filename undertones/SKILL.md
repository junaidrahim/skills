# Undertones

Junaid's reflective, observational writing project on Substack.

**URL:** https://myundertones.substack.com/

## What It Is

- Emo, introspective essays and short fiction
- "Writing a column for my life"
- Exercises in presence and reflection
- Letters, essays, character sketches
- Anti-brainrot — slow, intentional writing

## Voice & Style

- **Lowercase titles** — "the baddie at blossoms", not "The Baddie at Blossoms"
- **Literary prose** — sensory, evocative, unhurried
- **Vulnerable but not self-pitying** — tenderness without whining
- **Cultural commentary** — dating apps, scrolling, modern loneliness
- **References** — Rilke, Neruda, Ocean Vuong, Plath, cinema
- **Ends reflectively** — a question, a quiet truth, a softening

## Patterns

**Fiction as vehicle:**
Create characters (like Rehan in "baddie at blossoms") to explore real feelings. The character isn't real, but the ache is.

**The signature question:**
"Can you hear the music?" — from Oppenheimer. The recurring theme: are you living or just performing the notation of life?

**Structure:**

- No rigid format — let it breathe
- Often starts with a scene or observation
- Builds to emotional/philosophical insight
- Closes with reflection, sometimes direct address to reader
- "Thank you so much for reading" as sign-off

## Workflow

1. **Capture seed** — observation, feeling, fragment (in daily note or drafts)
2. **Draft in Obsidian** — `Notes/Undertones/` folder
3. **Let it sit** — don't publish immediately
4. **Edit on Substack** — paste draft, refine in their editor
5. **Publish**

## When Helping

- Match the intimate, literary voice
- Don't sanitize the emotion — let it be raw
- Suggest references that fit (poetry, film, philosophy)
- Push for specificity — concrete details over abstractions
- Ask: "What's the ache underneath this?"

## Examples

See published posts for reference:

- [undertones](https://myundertones.substack.com/p/undertones) — manifesto, "can you hear the music"
- [the baddie at blossoms](https://myundertones.substack.com/p/the-baddie-at-blossoms) — fiction, male yearning, bookstore

## Goal

Consistency. This is Junaid's practice of observational writing. Help him stay with it.

## The Practice

**"Writing a column for my life."**

This isn't just a Substack — it's a discipline. Regular observational writing
that forces presence and reflection. Like a columnist who files weekly,
but the beat is his own life.
