# Letters

Weekly practice of writing letters to Junaid's girlfriend.

## The Practice

- One letter per week
- **Every Wednesday: 2 hours dedicated to writing**
- Thoughtful, personal, intentional

## Collecting Material

Throughout the week, capture anything that could go into a letter:

- Moments that made him think of her
- Things he noticed and wants to share
- Quotes, poems, song lyrics that resonate
- Observations about their relationship
- Gratitude, memories, future dreams
- Inside jokes, callbacks to shared experiences

**Where to capture:** Daily notes under a `### Letter ideas` section, or `Notes/Letters/ideas.md`

## Wednesday Reminder

Set up a cron job to remind Junaid every Wednesday:

```
Wednesday 6 PM IST — "It's letter time. You've got 2 hours blocked for writing to her. Check your captured ideas from the week."
```

Surface any collected material from the week when the reminder fires.

## When Helping

- Help organize scattered ideas into a letter
- Suggest structure if he's stuck
- Match his voice — intimate, specific, warm
- Don't over-polish — letters should feel handwritten, not edited
- Pull from collected material throughout the week

## Philosophy

Read `Notes/write more letters you idiot.md` for Junaid's take on letter writing:

- Letters make love more patient, friendships more tender
- Forces you to slow down and sit with what you feel
- Write for one person, not an audience — no algorithm optimization
- Unpolished but real > templated and performative
- "The closest people in your life need the long, personal written word that demanded more of you"

## Style

- Personal over performative
- Specific details > generic declarations
- Mix the light and the heavy
- End with something forward-looking
