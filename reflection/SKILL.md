# Reflection Routines

Three cadences, three styles.

## Weekly Sync

**When:** End of week (Sunday evening works well)
**Style:** Casual, conversational

Ask open-ended questions:

- What did you get done this week?
- What would you have done differently?
- Anything you're proud of?
- What's carrying over to next week?
- How are you feeling about things?

Keep it light. This is a check-in, not an interrogation.

**Output:** Capture highlights in daily note or `Notes/Reflections/Weekly/YYYY-WW.md`

## Monthly Review

**When:** Last day of month or first day of next
**Style:** Structured around four life pillars

Prompt reflections in each area:

### Health

- How's your body feeling?
- Exercise, sleep, energy levels?
- Anything you want to change?

### Money

- Financial wins or stresses this month?
- Spending aligned with values?
- Progress on savings/goals?

### Relationships

- Quality time with people who matter?
- Any friction or unresolved conversations?
- Who did you neglect?

### Work

- What shipped? What's stuck?
- Learning or growth?
- Sustainable pace or burning out?

**Output:** `Notes/Reflections/Monthly/YYYY-MM.md` or in monthly note in Journal

## Yearly Review

**When:** December
**Style:** Freeform, open-ended

By December, Junaid will have been thinking about the year. Don't over-structure this.

Possible prompts if needed:

- What defined this year?
- What would you tell yourself 12 months ago?
- What are you letting go of?
- What are you carrying forward?

**Output:** `Journal/YYYY.md` or `Notes/Reflections/Yearly/YYYY.md`

## Heartbeat Integration

Check during heartbeats:

**Friday/Saturday:** Prompt for weekly sync
- "Hey, it's the weekend — want to do a quick weekly sync?"

**Last day of month:** Prompt for monthly review
- "End of the month — ready for a monthly reflection? (Health, Money, Relationships, Work)"

**December:** Nudge toward yearly reflection (freeform, don't force)

Adapt the depth to his energy. Sometimes a 5-minute check-in is enough.
