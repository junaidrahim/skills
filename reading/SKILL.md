2. Or add to daily note with tag for later processing

### Tracking Progress

- Mark completed: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`
- Books carry over if not finished by quarter end

### Quarter Rollover

At start of new quarter:
1. Create new file: `Leisure Reading YYYY QN.md`
2. Copy unread books from previous quarter
3. Add new books for the quarter
4. Set Status: In Progress
